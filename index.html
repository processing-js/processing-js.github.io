<h2>Processing.js 1.4.7 released!</h2>

<p>Since our last release, 1.4.1, Processing.js has been given a bit of a source code
overhaul, culminating in a new release: 1.4.7! This release adds in new functionality
that you might already know from Processing 2.0, but was missing in Processing.js such
as new methods in PVector and XML. The release model has also been changed: we're going
to be releasing a new version every time a merge in a patch that either fixes something,
or adds a feature that is still missing. This makes things way easier for us to manage,
and ensures that you don't have to wait months while updates slowly gather dust waiting
for a major release. You can download the new version of Processing.js over on the
<a href="/download">download</a> section, and let us know what's still missing!</p>

<p>As we're reshuffling the source code, some things are currently not available: the
API-only version of Processing.js was so insignificantly smaller than the regular version
that it will no longer be generated. The difference was about 10kb on 200kb, and the
added complexity of compiling an API-only version was simply not something that could be
taken on. If you want to help bring that back, we'd love to talk to you! We're also
not packaging the examples anymore, as a lot of them are actually incredibly out of date
and do not reflect proper Processing.js or even Processing approaches. Again, if you
want to help create a set of useful example again with us, get in touch!</p>

<h2>About Processing.js</h2>

<p>Processing.js is the sister project of the popular <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>
visual programming language, designed for the web. Processing.js makes your data visualizations,
digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards
and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in your web
page, and Processing.js does the rest. It's not magic, but almost.</p>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="http://benfry.com/">Ben Fry</a> and <a href="http://reas.com/">
Casey Reas</a>, Processing started as an open source programming language based on Java to help
the electronic arts and visual design communities learn the basics of computer programming in a
visual context. Processing.js takes this to the next level, allowing Processing code to be run
by any HTML5 compatible browser, including current versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and
Internet Explorer. Processing.js brings the best of visual programming to the web, both for
Processing and web developers.</p>

<p>Everything you need to work with Processing.js is here. You can <a href="/download/">download</a>
the most recent version of Processing.js, read Quick Start Guides for
<a href="/articles/p5QuickStart.html">Processing Developers</a> or
<a href="/articles/jsQuickStart.html">JavaScript Developers</a>,
<a href="/learning/">learn</a> about the Processing language and Processing.js
<a href="/articles/RenderingModes.html">render modes</a>, consult the
<a href="/reference/">Reference</a>, and of course view many existing <a href="/exhibition/">demos</a>
that use Processing.js. You can also <a href="/community/">get involved</a> with the Processing
and Processing.js communities, both of which are active and and looking for new users and developers.</p>

<p>Whether you're an advanced Processing developer or completely new, whether you're a pro with
web technologies or just getting started, Processing.js bridges the
gap between these two powerful technologies.</p>
