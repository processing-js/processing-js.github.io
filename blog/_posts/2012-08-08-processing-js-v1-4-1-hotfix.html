title: Processing.js v1.4.1 released
---
<p>Hot on the heels of 1.4.0 comes 1.4.1, which is an emergency
hotfix release to fix a regression issue introduced by issue <a
href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284/tickets/1755">#1775</a>,
which aimed to solve the problem of getting an I-bar cursor when
doing click-drags on a sketch. Long story short, the code intercepts
click events but forgot to set focus on the sketch. Without focus,
key events don't make it into the sketch so we had the unfortunate
situation where your sketch wouldn't respond to the keyboard.</p>

<p>This was fixed as issue <a
href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284/tickets/1883">#1883</a>
and should no longer cause any problems.</p>
