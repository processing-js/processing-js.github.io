title: Processing.js v1.4.0 released
---
<p>Processing.js 1.4.0! Yes, it's finally here, and it's a doozy. Many of the dev team have
been working on other projects over the last year, with some people wondering whether Processing.js
was a dead project, so just to reassure you: it is very much alive. However, we've had to make some
changes to the way we do releases now that we no longer have any developers dedicating all their time
to the project. So, let's start with the biggest change: a release! You can find the full list of
things that were added or fixed in the <a href="/blog">changelog</a>, but to give you a taste of
what's changed: SVG drawing to buffers now works, method overloading has been made far more robust,
XML with CDATA no longer breaks and the Processing 2.0 XML API is supported, IE9 no longer crashes
without the debug tools turned one, and we even managed to slip variable argument syntax (Type...
varname) into the parser. There's even a new extension to play with.<p>

<p>The second change is also relatively big: we're changing from spaced out, big releases to
relatively frequent, but small releases. This benefits everyone: you get more frequent updates
to Processing.js, and issues that you report (or contribute code for!) make it into the public
version much faster, and the people who work on Processing.js (a number of formerly full-time
devs are still involved with the project on a part time basis) can simply focus on getting two
or three important tickets out of the way each release, rather than spending time trying to work
through twenty or thirty. This makes things much more managable.</p>

<p>The <strong>tl;dr</strong> version; Processing 1.4.0 is out! Go <a href="/download/">download</a>
it! And to keep your coming back for more, expect 1.4.1 at the end of August!</p>

<p>As always: if you run into any problems with Processing.js, please file a
<a href="https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284-processingjs/tickets/new">
bug</a> or talk to us on <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/processing.js">IRC</a>
