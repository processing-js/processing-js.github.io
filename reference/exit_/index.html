		<td>Quits/stops/exits the program. Programs without a <b>draw()</b> function exit automatically after the last line has run, but programs with <b>draw()</b> run continuously until the program is manually stopped or <b>exit()</b> is run. 



<br /><br />

Rather than terminating immediately, <b>exit()</b> will cause the sketch to exit after <b>draw()</b> has completed (or after <b>setup()</b> completes if called during the <b>setup()</b> method).

<br /><br />

For Java programmers, this is <em>not</em> the same as System.exit(). Further, System.exit() should not be used because closing out an application while draw() is running may cause a crash (particularly with OpenGL).</td>
